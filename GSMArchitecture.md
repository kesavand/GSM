Mobile Station (MS):
A mobile station communicates across the air interface with a base station transceiver in the same cell in which the mobile subscriber unit is located. 

Base Station Subsystem (BSS)
The Base Station Subsystem (BSS) section of the GSM network architecture that is fundamentally associated with communicating with the mobiles on the network. It consists of two elements:

BTS
Base Transceiver Station (BTS): Â  The BTS used in a GSM network comprises the radio transmitter receivers, and their associated antennas that transmit and receive to directly communicate with the mobiles.

BSC:
Base Station Controller (BSC):   The BSC forms the next stage back into the GSM network. It controls a group of BTSs,It communicates with the BTSs over what is termed the Abis interface.

Network Switching Subsystem (NSS):
The NSS has one hardware, Mobile switching center and four software database element: Home location register (HLR), Visitor location Register (VLR), Authentications center (Auc) and Equipment Identity Register (EIR). The MSC basically performs the switching function of the system by controlling calls to and from other telephone and data systems. It includes functions such as network interfacing and common channel signalling.

Mobile switching center (MSC)
The mobile switching center (MSC) is the primary service delivery node responsible for routing voice calls and SMS, MSC sets up and releases the end-to-end connection, handles mobility and hand-over requirements during the call
The visited MSC (V-MSC) is the MSC where a customer is currently located. The visitor location register (VLR) associated with this MSC will have the subscriber's data in it.
The gateway MSC (G-MSC) is the MSC that determines which "visited MSC" (V-MSC) the subscriber who is being called is currently located at. It also interfaces with the PSTN.
The anchor MSC is the MSC from which a handover has been initiated. The target MSC is the MSC toward which a handover should take place.
media gateway (MGW) makes it possible to cross-connect circuit switched calls switched by using IP, ATM AAL2 as well as TDM. More information is available in 3GPP TS 23.205.
